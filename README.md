## Idea and Goals

### Idea

### Goals

## Schematic

## Parts
You can find a bill of materials (BOM) file for LCSC in the repository. Not included are pinheaders, solar panel and the lithium-ion battery.
## Software
Software will be developed once I received and built the first prototype. Hang in there.

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks go out to my amateur radio friends who helped me a lot during design of the schematic and PCB:
* Mathias Weyland
* Oliver
* Rune Broberg

You guys show us that amateur radio still is about experimenting with hardware and software, and that it is even more amazing to do so nowadays than ever before. This international community is amazing and I encourage everyone interested in tinkering, creating and engineering to join us.
